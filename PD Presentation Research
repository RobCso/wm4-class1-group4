Top Rank Food Bank – A Social Enterprise. 

Social enterprises are businesses that put the interests of people and planet ahead of shareholder gain. They are driven by a social/environmental mission and reinvest profits into creating positive social change. At Top Rank Food Bank we will combine entrepreneurial methods toward the need to raise awareness of current trends in the foodbank arena by using data driven approaches to gaining robust information which can be used to inform the public discourse about the current cost of living crisis, and then re-investing our marketing and data procuring profits into a front of house Food Bank, directly addressing the needs of the most economically marginalised sections of society. 


The Current State of Foodbanks in the UK

There are over 1,400 Trussell Trust food banks in the UK, in addition to at least 1,172 independent food banks. The trust also suggests that immediately before the Covid epidemic the percentage of UK households using foodbanks was around 2.5%. This number is highly likely to increase over the coming months given the cost of living crisis expected to become greater as the winter comes closer and household bills begin to increase. This increases the business case for a company looking to understand the root causes and address the needs associated. 


The State of Foodbanks Locally

Food banks in Birmingham have given out 53,319 parcels to adults and children in the last year. For every 100,000 people in the city, a total of 4,500 have received help to feed themselves from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.
Birmingham foodbanks are reporting a 40% increase in visitors over the summer, and this is again likely to rise given the ongoing energy bills increases. Birmingham has an unemployment rate twice that of the national average and child poverty rates are also much higher that the national average, meaning that increases in food bank use are likely to be exponetial to national trends.
